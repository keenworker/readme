#  Right Shift Operator (`>>`) and Left Shift Operator (`<<`)
---

## Right Shift Operator (`>>`) in C++

### Overview:

The right shift operator (`>>`) is a bitwise operator in C++ that shifts the bits of a value to the right by a specified number of positions. This operation is equivalent to dividing the value by 2 raised to the power of the specified number.

### Syntax:

```cpp
result = value >> numberOfPositions;
```

### Example:

```cpp
int x = 16;    // Binary representation: 0001 0000
int result = x >> 2;  // Shifting 2 positions to the right

// After the operation, result = 4
// Binary representation: 0000 0100
```

## Left Shift Operator (`<<`) in C++

### Overview:

The left shift operator (`<<`) is a bitwise operator in C++ that shifts the bits of a value to the left by a specified number of positions. This operation is equivalent to multiplying the value by 2 raised to the power of the specified number.

### Syntax:

```cpp
result = value << numberOfPositions;
```

### Example:

```cpp
int y = 2;    // Binary representation: 0000 0010
int result = y << 3;  // Shifting 3 positions to the left

// After the operation, result = 16
// Binary representation: 0001 0000
```

### Important Notes:

- When shifting bits to the right, the leftmost bits are filled with the sign bit (0 for positive numbers, 1 for negative numbers in two's complement representation).
- When shifting bits to the left, the rightmost bits are filled with zeros.

## Applications:

### Right Shift Operator (`>>`):

1. **Division by Powers of 2:** It can be used as a faster alternative to integer division by powers of 2.

2. **Bitwise Operations:** It's commonly used in bitwise operations to extract or modify specific bits in a value.

### Left Shift Operator (`<<`):

1. **Multiplication by Powers of 2:** It can be used as a faster alternative to integer multiplication by powers of 2.

2. **Bitwise Operations:** Similar to the right shift operator, it's used in bitwise operations to set or clear specific bits.

These operators are very useful in low-level bit manipulation, as well as in some performance optimizations. However, care should be taken when using them to ensure that the intended behavior is achieved.
